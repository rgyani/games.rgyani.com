1. **First you must install Ruby because Jekyll is a Ruby-based program and needs Ruby to run**.
    * Go to RubyInstaller for Windows. (https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
    * Under RubyInstallers, download and install one of the Ruby installers under the WITH DEVKIT list (usually the recommended/highlighted option).
    * Double-click the downloaded file and proceed through the wizard to install it. Run the **ridk install** step on the last stage of the installation wizard.
    * Open a new command prompt window or Git Bash session.


2. **Install the Jekyll gem**
```code
gem install jekyll
```

3. **run jekyll serve**
```code
jekyll serve
```
