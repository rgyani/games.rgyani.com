### The Story

You awaken in the aftermath of a catastrophic plane crash, alone and isolated from the rest of the world. With no smartphone, no tools, and no modern comforts, you must rely on your instincts and the harsh wilderness around you. **Your only hope lies in reaching the wreckage of the aircraft to repair the radio and call for help.**  

But the journey is treacherous. Cliffs, slick slopes, and dizzying heights make even the simplest tasks perilous.  


Unlike traditional survival games, **Wild Horizon** isn't about chopping down trees, gathering stones, or building cozy shelters. **Let's be real—you're not here to start a new life in the wild!** Your goal is to get back home.

### Precision-Based Movement

Your survival depends on mastering a set of fluid traversal mechanics designed to test your skill and strategy:
- Climb ledges, mantle plateaus and leap across gaps
- Wall runs across narrow gaps for heart-pounding escapes.
- Rope swings over deep chasms and climbs to scale sheer vertical surfaces.
- Wall edge clings to navigate perilous ledges and tight spaces.  
 
Each maneuver is designed to test your precision and timing while offering unique solutions to environmental challenges.

### Stamina: Your Key to Survival

Your journey relies purely on your skills, timing, and quick thinking. Every leap, every climb, every jump between ledges drains your stamina. 

**You'll need to manage your stamina wisely**—lose focus, and you risk slipping, plummeting into the depths below

### Nature's Ferocious Hunters

But the wilderness isn't just about cliffs and heights. **Predatory animals lurk here, too**. Unlike other games, blasting your way through isn't an option. Let's face it—facing a bloodthirsty wolf or a 400-pound grizzly with makeshift gear isn't going to end well...for you. These animals are fierce hunters, but you've got something they don't: **wits**. Outsmarting them is your best bet.

### Think, Solve, Survive

Throughout your journey, you'll find **locked suitcases** that could contain life-saving items—but opening them isn't as simple as turning a key. You'll need keen observation and logical deduction to open them, while a wrong combination will set you back, forcing you to reassess and try again.
