Ready to run, jump, swing, and slide through obstacle courses so wild they’d make a stunt double quit? 



Welcome to **Dhadoom**!—a parkour racer where you defy gravity, conquer chaos, and taunt giant hammers while swinging for the win!


Show off your parkour prowess with a wild arsenal of moves:
* **Sprint and vault** like you’re outrunning a herd of caffeinated squirrels.
* **Swing on ropes** across gaping chasms, channeling your inner action hero (minus the stunt double).
* **Slide** under obstacles with slick style - or just pray your face doesn’t eat dirt.
* **Cling to ledges** and nail those jumps, because gravity’s not your hype man!
* **Push or dodge giant boxes** - parkour’s version of “surprise, you’re a mover now!”
* Outsmart **swinging hammers and pendulums** that have a personal grudge and zero chill.


Race through chaotic playgrounds packed with splashy water, slippery mud, and crunchy snow—every step, stomp, and slide leaves epic ripples to prove you’re a parkour legend. Why let the environment sleep on your greatness?

Face-off against a cast of quirky AI challengers, each with their own “unique” personalities and questionable tactics. They might be fast, sneaky, or just plain goofy, but one thing’s for sure — they’ll keep you on your toes.

**Multiplayer is coming soon**, so you can challenge your friends to find out who’s the real parkour king or queen — or just who falls flat on their face the most.


Whether you’re chasing personal bests, outsmarting AI, or gearing up for future multiplayer chaos, Dhadoom! delivers adrenaline-pumping parkour thrills with a big goofy grin.



Get ready to dominate, wipe out, and laugh at your own glorious disasters—Dhadoom! is here to test your skills and your sanity!
