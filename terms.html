    <h2>3. What legal terms do I need to be aware of for Subscriptions?</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions are automatic regular payments that continue for the Subscription Period until cancelled.</p>
    <p>Subscription fees are charged automatically on or before the beginning of each Subscription Period. Apple's App Store, Google's Google Play or Amazon platform may place a temporary "authorisation hold" or "pending charge" on your payment card before any payment is due (including during a free trial period). </p>
    <p>A Subscription is automatically renewed at the end of each Subscription Period unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period. If you do not cancel the Subscription at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period, the Subscription fees for the next Subscription Period will be taken during the 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period</p>
    <p>If a Subscription fee cannot be taken due to the absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reasons, the Subscription will not automatically end. The Subscription will automatically restart as soon as valid payment details are provided. Cancellation of a Subscription can only be done at your manual request. Please see the section below "How can I cancel a Subscription" for further details.</p>


    <h2>4. Can I cancel my order once I have bought a Subscription?</h2>
    <p>You cannot cancel your Subscription for the current Subscription Period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a Subscription. However, you may cancel your Subscription for the next Subscription Period following the steps set out below.</p>

    <h2>5. Are Subscription fees refundable?</h2>
    <p>No. Except where required by law or at our sole discretion, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>6. Can Subscription fees change?</h2>
    <p>We may modify the Subscription fee at our sole discretion and at any time. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the current Subscription period. You will be provided reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fee. If you disagree with the change in Subscription fee, you may cancel your Subscription for the next Subscription Period following the steps set out in the section "How can I cancel a Subscription?".</p>

    <h2>7. Can Subscription content change?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we may modify the rewards and perks of each Subscription in our Services at our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>8. Why has my payment card been charged before payment is due?</h2>
    <p>All payment, billing and transaction processes are handled by the relevant third-party distributor or platform such as Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play. However, we understand that these platforms may place a temporary "authorisation hold" or "pending charge" on your payment card before any payment is due (including during a free trial period). This is an action outside of our control for the purposes of preventing credit card fraud but we understand no payment is actually taken from you until the 24 period prior to the commencement of a paid subscription period.</p>

    <h2>9. I have an issue with my Subscription. Who do I contact?</h2>
    <p>All payment, billing and transaction processes are handled by the relevant third-party distributor or platform such as Apple's App Store, Google's Google Play or Amazon.
